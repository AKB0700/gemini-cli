The job failed because Gulp is not installed locally in your repository. The error message states:

> [19:38:13] Local gulp not found in ~/work/gemini-cli/gemini-cli  
> [19:38:13] Try running: npm install gulp

**Solution:**
Add `gulp` as a development dependency in your project before running any Gulp tasks.

### How to Fix

1. In your repository directory, run:
   ```sh
   npm install --save-dev gulp
   ```

2. Make sure your `package.json` lists gulp in `devDependencies`:
   ```json
   "devDependencies": {
     "gulp": "^<latest-version>"
   }
   ```

3. If you use a workflow file for GitHub Actions (your workflow is at [.github/workflows/npm-gulp.yml](https://github.com/AKB0700/gemini-cli/blob/8942f196e773d42943abbbacd9931c0e2f1bc05d/.github/workflows/npm-gulp.yml)), ensure there is a step to install dependencies before running Gulp commands:
   ```yaml
   - name: Install dependencies
     run: npm install
   ```

   This should appear before any Gulp-related steps.

---

**Summary:**  
Install Gulp using `npm install --save-dev gulp`, verify it's in your `package.json`, and ensure your workflow runs `npm install` first. This will resolve the job failure and allow your Gulp build task to execute successfully.
